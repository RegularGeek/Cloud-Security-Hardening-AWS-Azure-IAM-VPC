# ☁️ Cloud Security Hardening – AWS | Azure | IAM | VPC

This project focuses on securing cloud environments by applying hardening best practices to IAM, networking, storage, and monitoring in AWS and Azure.

---

## 📜 Overview
Misconfigured cloud environments are a major attack vector. This project provides security hardening scripts and guidelines to protect cloud assets against unauthorized access, data exposure, and network attacks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- AWS CLI & Azure CLI
- Bash scripting
- Terraform (optional future expansion)
- IAM, S3, VPC, CloudTrail, Azure Monitor

---

## 🔍 Process Workflow
1. Audit current cloud configurations for security risks.
2. Apply hardening to:
   - IAM roles, enforcing MFA and least privilege.
   - Storage (S3, Azure Blob), disabling public access.
   - Networking (VPC, NSG) with strict ingress/egress rules.
   - Enable logging: AWS CloudTrail, VPC flow logs, Azure Monitor.
3. Test security controls before and after applying fixes.

---

## 📊 Results
- Reduced attack surface by disabling unnecessary public endpoints.
- Enforced secure authentication for all cloud users.
- Improved visibility into cloud activities with logs and alerts.
